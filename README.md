# 💳 BillBuddy
BillBuddy is a simple console-based bill splitting and tracking application.
Originally created as a mini project during my B.Tech 3rd year, this version is a recreation from memory after the original files were lost. A web-based version will be developed and maintained in a future repository.

## 🛠 Features
- Add and view itemized expenses
- Calculate total and split bills among users
- Simple console-based interface
- Beginner-friendly code structure

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Rebuild as a full-stack web application
- Add user authentication
- Store expense history
- UI for better user experience
